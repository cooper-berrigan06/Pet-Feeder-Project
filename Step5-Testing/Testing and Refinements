Test A – Pets eat as expected
Set up: Hopper has food, sensors work, target = 100g, eat time = 20 minutes
Steps: Dispense food, confirmed food flowed, logged, wait up to 20 minutes
Expected: 100g dispensed, >70g eaten in 20 minutes, no alert
Test B – pet does not eat
Set up: Hopper has food, sensors working, target = 100g, eat time 20 minutes
Steps: Dispense, confirmed food flowed, wait 20 minutes
Expected: 100g dispensed, <70g eaten in 20 minutes, send alert “food not eaten in set time”
Test C – Food hopper empty
Set up: Hopper does not have food, target = 100g
Steps: Dispense food, confirm food flowed
Expected: The weight sensor does not confirm food flowed, send alert “food not dispensed”
Test D – Jam during dispense
Set up: Hopper has food, tries to dispense food
Steps: tries to dispense
Expected: the weight sensor does not confirm food flowed, send alert “food not dispensed”
System Refinements
Add short top up feature for if dispense is to low on weight scale
If weight unchanged after dispense try again as it may be jammed and then send alert
Add sensor to check if hopper is empty and then add alert
