# Pet-Feeder-Project
This project is a **logic and behaviour simulation** of a low-cost automated pet feeder for cats and dogs.  
It is designed for shelters that need a reliable way to dispense food on schedule, monitor consumption, and alert staff if there is a problem (e.g., jam, hopper empty, pet not eating).
